# Counter-Pyhton3
A script that display a timer counting both ways

In order to have this program work you need to install playsound module.
You can do this by executing in the cmd the command

pip install playsound==1.2.2

We are installing version 1.2.2 because the newest is not stable and does not work as of 7/1/2021

Another we need to do, is to ensure that the sound file is not in the same folder as the program.
So choose another folder to save the sound, copy the location and replace it  the current.
